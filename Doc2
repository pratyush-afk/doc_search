Meeting Notes: Project Phoenix

Project Phoenix aims to refactor the company's legacy monolith application into a microservices architecture.
This initiative is driven by the need for better scalability and faster feature deployment.
The team has decided on using Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration.
Java and Spring Boot will be used for the new microservices.
A major challenge identified is data migration from the old database. The team is evaluating PostgreSQL as the new standard.
